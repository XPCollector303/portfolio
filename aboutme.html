                Hello! My name is Sam and I like computers, studying, and cybersecurity.
                I am currently at high-school, in classe de Seconde in France, learning about cybersecurity, programming, defending endpoints, and detecting threats in both network level and host level.
                Furthermore I also like playing video games, especially Geometry Dash (my hardest is Boxing Boxes :D).
                Finally I like playing the piano, and I have been doing it for 7 years now. I also train calisthenics, with skills mastered such as the frog stand, the L sit, and the elbow lever. Currently trying to master the handstand.
